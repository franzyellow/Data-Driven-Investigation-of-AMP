 abstract = {Anthropological approaches to understanding regional household economic strategies in complex societies have been poorly theorized and modeled. This paper contributes to theoretical development in this area by describing a model based on intensification and diversification. Then, the model is evaluated using systematic archaeological, historical, and ethnographic data from five premodern/early modern states (Mesoamerica, England, Mediterranean Europe, China, and Thailand). The results indicate that peasant households made decisions regarding agricultural intensification and craft specialization that match theoretical expectations based on a rational-choice approach. Cross-culturally, the outcome of these choices has been the development of a spatial division of labor with agricultural intensification in areas of prime arable land and a mix of extensive agriculture and craft specialization in marginal areas, under specific demand conditions. This model provides an alternative to the traditional approaches of neoevolutionism and the Asiatic mode of production (e.g., Marx, Polanyi, Sahlins).},

The place of casteism in the larger matrix of the "Asiatic mode of production" can only be understood if the Eurocentric reasoning and the search for a fictitious "Indian feudalism" are avoided. This would also end the consequent illusory search for the transition from feudalism to capitalism, which has rendered the project of socialism in India to be a mirage.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the political and social elements of land reform in Iran and explains why the state was unable to embark on a successful restructuring of agrarian relations via equitable land-relations, economic productivity, and regional development. It is argued that lack of grass-roots participation in the program, mismanagement of resources, state corruption, and ihsensitivity to the Asiatic mode of production were responsible for the program's failure. To support this hypothesis particular attention is paid to the impact of land reform on landless peasants (Khushnesheen) and small landholders who, in theory, were targeted to become the main beneficiaries. A detailed description of agrarian social classes as well as land ownership and pattern of land cultivation prior and after the reform are also provided.},

 abstract = {There is no universal trajectory from kinship-ordered egalitarian to state-ordered stratified society. Two divergent, `pristine' state forms evolved, corresponding to quite distinct ecological/historical impulses. The `Asiatic'/Village-State mode of production emerged from an identifiable centre on the basis of a geographically extensive and largely uniform ecology, with descent groups remaining the corporate societal elements. By contrast the organic urbanism of City-State Mesopotamia emerged from topographical diversity in an open-ended positive feedback system with many diverse inputs. In the process new minimal lineage forms developed embedded in, and subsumed by, the household as a larger co-residential grouping, the latter displacing the kinship idiom as the basic mode of social organisation in the emerging urban society. Stratification occurred not on the basis of the `conical clan`, as in the Village-State, but within households (differential relationship to the core descent grouping) and between households (differential control over means of production). Thus City-State stratification/urbanism was rooted in economic differentiation, as opposed to ideological and political differentiation in the Village-State.},

 abstract = {This paper explores some sailent changes in the political economy of Thanjavur district, from about 850 A D to the present, with the aid of Marx's formulations of modes of production and of related concepts by other writers. In passing, and by way of contrast, it also considers the corresponding developments in the growth of production relations in Kerala between the ninth and the middle of the eighteenth centuries. The object of the paper is to illuminate a particular course of historical development, and to make certain points of wider theoretical interest. It argues that there was an Asiatic mode of production in the Hindu kingdoms of most of southern India prior to foreign conquest and that the Asiatic mode in Thanjavur, while conforming to Marx's model in fundamental respects, permitted greater social change and development of productive forces than Marx's model allows for. Marx's formulations of 'modes of productions', while brilliantly illuminating historical development of western Europe and the dynamics of capitalism, do not and were not intended to suffice for the theoretical discussion of the history of Asia or the world at large. What is attempted in this paper is not a theoretical framework for such a vast exercise; instead, the paper tries to place Marx's formulation of modes of production in a broader setting of cultural evolutionary theory, and use them to understand changing production relations in Southern India.},

 abstract = {Sanders and Price, Palerm, Carrasco, and others have argued for the utility of the theoretical formulations of "oriental despotism" and the "Asiatic mode of production" for the investigation and comprehension of Aztec political organization and society. Accordingly, it has been claimed that irrigation played an important role in the consolidation of Aztec states, that no significant private property in land existed among the Aztecs, and that government control of the economy was thoroughgoing and complete. All of these theoretically generated positions are demonstrably false, at least for the important Aztec state of Texcoco. Irrigation played no significant role in the origin or consolidation of the Texcocan state; extensive private property in land did exist among the Texcocans, and the government of Texcoco did not at all dominate the Texcocan economy. Marketing was clearly the principal mechanism within the empire for the transference of goods. The basic principles of Aztec society are to be discovered through objective examination of the ethnohistorical and archaeological data and cannot be determined through the imposition of inappropriate or outmoded theoretical formulations.},

 abstract = {Foursov's and Pivovarov's concepts are shown in a systematic overview. Their intellectual origins are traced back to the Russian Africanist Vladimir Kiyiov's analysis of precapitalist modes of production centering on different correlations of individual and collective forms of labor. The latter was characterized as the Asiatic mode of production, which did not develop much dynamism. The Christian historical subjects, centered on individualism, were more expansive, but the Russian- Orthodox differed from the Latin-Christian by expanding in space, not time. Following the revolutions of the sixteenth century the historical subject of Russia came to be power, that of the Latin-Christian world capital. The main components of the modern "Russian system" are power and population--a third component "intelligentsia" being the weakest part. This concept is criticized from the point of view that the specific traits of Russian history may better be explained by Russia's place in the semiperiphery of the "European world-system" than by defining it as an own "Russian system."},

Presenting both its origin in the revisionist debates of the Khrushchev and Brezhnev eras and its recent application in an innovative analysis of Russian colonialism in Alaska by the ethnohistorian A. V. Grinev, Sonja Luehrmann attempts to grasp the intellectual complexity of Semenov's work. While the Soviet debate on the Asiatic mode of production has been read as Aesopian criticism of the USSR, it may more fruitfully be seen as an argument against a strict five-stage scheme of historical evolution that opened up new possibilities of concrete empirical analysis and a new theoretical role for ethnography as the science of noncapitalist societies. Grinev's use of politarism in the 1990s shows the lasting explanatory value of the concept as well as the need to understand the origins of Soviet intellectual traditions in order to critically engage with them.},

 abstract = {In liberal social science the main protagonists of the nomothetic versus idiographic dilemma were social science and history. In Soviet Marxism, the situation was more complicated. For several reasons, mainly political, a third agent, Orientalism, appeared. The attempts to integrate Orientalism into the structure of historical materialism threatened to ruin the entire Marxist scheme of history, with its five stages, and instead counterpose historical materialism with "historical Orientalism." This threatened to reverse the relationship between nature and society, base and superstructure, class and state. The debate over the Asiatic Mode of Production (AMP) showed clearly to integrate the history of the West and the history of the East (Orientalism) into historical materialism was impossible. Linear and cyclical social times were unbridgeable with one and the same scientific disciplinary space. The debates between historical materialism and historical Orientalism, and the nomothetic versus the idiographic dilemma in liberal social science, reflect two deep and serious problems. 1) Different social systems have different social times. These demand different disciplines which are difficult to integrate within one discipline. 2) In addition, there is the time of the historical subject. This subject creates social systems and not the other way around. To construct a unidisciplinary socio-historical science is only the first step in unthinking social science and the nineteenth century legacy. "La Nouvelle Alliance" between social science and history demands something more radical--the elaboration of a new system of knowledge about the world: one that is subject-centered, and not system-centered.},

 abstract = {The theoretical foundation for Soviet studies of social relations in traditional and semi-traditional China was based on Lenin's version of the Marxist theory of social-economic formations. Unlike Marx, who identified two different trends in world history, which represented the unique Western and Eastern historical experiences, Lenin emphasized the universal character of the development of human civilization. In his view, the "feudal mode of production" was the basis for the system of social-economic relations in all parts of the world prior to the emergence of the "capitalist mode of production" in the West. This approach to the world in general, and to Chinese history in particular, became an unchallengeable paradigm in the late 1930s, when the partisans of the "Asiatic mode of production" among Soviet historians were defeated. Nevertheless, even after the concept of the "Asiatic mode of production" was declared to be "anti-Marxist and anti-scientific," the latent controversy between these two paradigms in Soviet sinology became the essence of the polemics on the nature of the Chinese form of feudalism and the driving social force behind the Chinese revolution. Recently, Russian Sinology has demonstrated a retreat to some of the arguments of the partisans of the "Asiatic mode of production" under the framework of "Chinese traditional society."},

 abstract = {This paper reveals that the household does not appear to have been the unit in which the inheritance of commodities and rights, both symbolic and allocative, occurred, at least not during the Yayoi period on the Japanese archipelago when hierarchy was developing. Instead, the grouping which in this paper is called the basic unit—consisting of around five houses with a shared cluster of storage facilities and a burial ground—functioned in this fashion throughout the period. When social differentiation began in the Late Yayoi period, what became hierarchically situated were not households but these larger units of five or so households probably consisting of siblings, their spouses, and children. The lack of significant evidence of a fixed chiefly position in a particular household over a number of generations suggests that this larger grouping, with its archaeologically recognizable cluster of houses and probably representing a clan segment (i.e., lineage), functioned as a stable pool of candidates for the position of the “chief” of a clan. The development of a social hierarchy based upon a clan-segment rather than a household-based social grouping may have preserved a sense of communal togetherness and equality and enabled the moblization of labor, two characteristics of the classic Asiatic mode of production and state formation.},

 abstract = {The social organization of irrigation agriculture is an important part of many theories of the origin of the state. Ever since Marx described the organization and control of irrigation agriculture as a central task of rulers in Oriental societies, scholars have debated whether extensive irrigation could have existed in preindustrial societies without state intervention. In the Balinese case, Geertzs theater state and Lansings democratic irrigation model are explicitly understood as disconfirming Marxs theory of the Asiatic mode of production and Wittfogels theory of Oriental despotism. This study examines the basis for the theories of Geertz and Lansing and finds that it is only a selective reading of the sources and the partial use of ethnographic data that has permitted their construction. Further discussion of the connection between irrigation and centralized regulation by the state is therefore once again on the agenda. On the basis of this critical reexamination, a theoretical approach to the precolonial Balinese state is developed in which the mobilization of large numbers of neighborhoods to regularly repeated migrations to state templespilgrimagesbrought people from otherwise unrelated areas together to form localities that were essential to the states imagined community.},
