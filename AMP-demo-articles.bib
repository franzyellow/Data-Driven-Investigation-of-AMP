  abstract = {Anthropological approaches to understanding regional household economic strategies in complex societies have been poorly theorized and modeled. This paper contributes to theoretical development in this area by describing a model based on intensification and diversification. Then, the model is evaluated using systematic archaeological, historical, and ethnographic data from five premodern/early modern states (Mesoamerica, England, Mediterranean Europe, China, and Thailand). The results indicate that peasant households made decisions regarding agricultural intensification and craft specialization that match theoretical expectations based on a rational-choice approach. Cross-culturally, the outcome of these choices has been the development of a spatial division of labor with agricultural intensification in areas of prime arable land and a mix of extensive agriculture and craft specialization in marginal areas, under specific demand conditions. This model provides an alternative to the traditional approaches of neoevolutionism and the Asiatic mode of production (e.g., Marx, Polanyi, Sahlins).}

  abstract = {In liberal social science the main protagonists of the nomothetic versus idiographic dilemma were social science and history. In Soviet Marxism, the situation was more complicated. For several reasons, mainly political, a third agent, Orientalism, appeared. The attempts to integrate Orientalism into the structure of historical materialism threatened to ruin the entire Marxist scheme of history, with its five stages, and instead counterpose historical materialism with "historical Orientalism." This threatened to reverse the relationship between nature and society, base and superstructure, class and state. The debate over the Asiatic Mode of Production (AMP) showed clearly to integrate the history of the West and the history of the East (Orientalism) into historical materialism was impossible. Linear and cyclical social times were unbridgeable with one and the same scientific disciplinary space. The debates between historical materialism and historical Orientalism, and the nomothetic versus the idiographic dilemma in liberal social science, reflect two deep and serious problems. 1) Different social systems have different social times. These demand different disciplines which are difficult to integrate within one discipline. 2) In addition, there is the time of the historical subject. This subject creates social systems and not the other way around. To construct a unidisciplinary socio-historical science is only the first step in unthinking social science and the nineteenth century legacy. "La Nouvelle Alliance" between social science and history demands something more radical–the elaboration of a new system of knowledge about the world: one that is subject-centered, and not system-centered.}

  abstract = {This paper examines the political and social elements of land reform in Iran and explains why the state was unable to embark on a successful restructuring of agrarian relations via equitable land-relations, economic productivity, and regional development. It is argued that lack of grass-roots participation in the program, mismanagement of resources, state corruption, and ihsensitivity to the Asiatic mode of production were responsible for the program's failure. To support this hypothesis particular attention is paid to the impact of land reform on landless peasants (Khushnesheen) and small landholders who, in theory, were targeted to become the main beneficiaries. A detailed description of agrarian social classes as well as land ownership and pattern of land cultivation prior and after the reform are also provided.}
